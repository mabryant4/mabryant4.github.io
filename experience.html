      <p style="font-size:18px">In Spring 2020, Spring 2021, and Fall 2021, I worked for the University of Alabama College of Continuing Studies (CCS) as a Student Web Developer. In Spring 2020, I learned how to build and modify a Model View Controller (MVC) Website using ASP.NET, C#, SQL, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I worked with a team to make modifications and updates to the CCS website utilizing Git-based source control. In Spring and Fall of 2021, I assisted with the transition of the CRM and database to Salesforce. This role included development and administrative tasks within Salesforce, as well as data analysis and visualization using built-in Salesforce technologies.

      <p style="font-size:18px">In Fall 2020 I worked for the University of Alabama College of Computer Science as a Grader for CS 300 Operating Systems. In this position, I graded projects on topics such as virtual memory and priority queues. I helped students understand the reason for their grades by answering questions and providing thorough feedback on errors.

      <p style="font-size:18px">In Fall 2019 I worked for the University of Alabama College of Computer Science as a Teaching Assistant for CS 100. In this position, I instructed students in basic programing skills and assisted them with Lab assignments. My go-to way to assist a struggling student was using visual learning to illustrate what was happening in their program and help them understand the meaning behind their code.

      <br>
      <p style="font-size:18px">I interned virtually with International Paper (IP) in Summer 2020 and Summer 2021. My first summer, after learning how to use SAP, I worked on a developer-facing software update building a more efficient file-to-table conversion tool, specifically focusing on the CSV file format and modifying the tool interface. I also assisted a team of IP employees in an Agile development for a SAPUI5 Sales application, participating in daily stand-ups and tracking progress with Azure DevOps. My second summer, I worked with the HR Application Development team to create a proof-of-concept Fiori application for HR forms and processes, using ABAP, Javascript, and XML to improve the UI. Both summers I was able to participate in all steps of the software development lifecycle through research, design, development, testing, and documentation.
