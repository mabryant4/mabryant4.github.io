      <h3>Association for Computing Machinery</h3>
      <p style="font-size:18px">I have been a member of the UA ACM Organization for my entire college career and moved into the year-long position of Treasurer in my Spring 2020 semester. ACM conducts meetings discussing relevant topics in technology, educating members on important skills, and hosting companies recruiting CS majors. As treasurer, I assisted the other members on the board with planning and presenting these meetings, as well as managing the organization’s budget, including tracking spending, approving expenses, and coordinating with donors. This has given me the opportunity to improve my financial management skills and make valuable connections with peers and company representatives.

      <h3>Al's Pals Mentorship Program</h3>
      <p style="font-size:18px">I volunteered as a mentor with Al’s Pals in my Spring 2018 semester and as a grade leader from Fall 2018 to Fall 2019. Al’s Pals is a program which partners UA students with local elementary school students to provide mentoring including homework assistance, skill-building exercises, and stress-relieving games. As a grade leader, I managed classes of 3rd grade mentees and their mentors, leading them through a curriculum of activities and solving problems as they arose. From this experience I learned about facilitating constructive communication and learning from mistakes to proactively solve problems.

      <h3>Love Your Melon Campus Crew</h3>
      <p style="font-size:18px">I volunteered with the Love Your Melon UA Campus Crew from Fall 2019 to Spring 2020, after which it was unfortunately ended due to COVID-19. Love Your Melon Campus Crews work with the brand to promote awareness of Childhood Cancer and help their partner organizations, like DKMS and Alex’s Lemonade Stand, host events on campus. For example, our Crew hosted a DKMS Bone Marrow Donation Registration Drive and recruited over 100 students to the Bone Marrow Donor Registry.

      <h3>NCWIT Aspire Program</h3>I served as an Assistant Instructor for the Tuscaloosa NCWIT Aspire Program in Spring 2020, after which it did not continue due to complications caused by COVID-19. In this program, I helped instruct a class of middle-school girls in learning basic CS skills using skill-building activities and Scratch programming assignments. Through this program we encouraged young girls to pursue CS studies by showing them how fun and creative programming can be.

      <h3>Intern Hackathon</h3>
      <p style="font-size:18px">During my Summer 2020 internship with International Paper I competed in their Intern Hackathon with 3 of my colleagues. Our task was to find a more efficient and informative way to organize and display customer complaints. My team created an interactive PowerBI dashboard connected to the SQL database holding complaint data, which generated reports based on a variety of factors such as mill location and defect type. Our project was named Most Innovative Hack due to the use of innovative technologies and the ease of usability.

      <h3>College Hackathons</h3>I have participated in multiple college hackathons, including Crimson Hacks 2019, Vandy Hacks 2019, and Auburn Hacks 2020. At Crimson Hacks 2019, my team created an iOS goal-tracking app which integrated with Snapchat to allow for goal sharing and collaboration. We were awarded prizes for Best Female Hack, Best Diverse Hack, and Best Use of SnapKit, the Snapchat API.

    <h2 style="text-align:center">Art</h2>
      <p style="font-size:18px">Art has always been one of my greatest passions. I began taking art classes in middle school and continued until AP Art in high school. Throughout that time, I created pieces which one several awards, such as Second Place in the Draw Montgomery competition and First Place at the Alabama National Fair. Two pieces of my work have been displayed in the Montgomery Museum of Fine Arts and I have won timed sidewalk-chalk drawing competitions twice. I have intertwined art and volunteering by helping create a mural for a Montgomery community garden and painting Portraits of Orphans as part of the Orphan Project. One of my favorite ways to create art is in on-stage performance, where an idea emerges on the canvas representative of the accompanying music.

      <p style="font-size:18px">This piece, titled “We are all of us stars,” quoting Marilyn Monroe, depicts her, Aristotle, and Van Gogh combined into one face, revealing the beauty which arises from the combination of intelligence, charisma, and creativity. It won first place in the High School division at the Alabama National Fair in 2016. The medium is oil.

      <p style="font-size:18px">These 3 pieces represent a section of my AP Art concentration, where I depicted the emotions and effects of mental illness. This section depicts eating disorders, with the first piece portraying body dysmorphia, the second portraying Bulimia and inspired by the style of Salvador Dali, and the third portraying unrealistic societal expectations of beauty.
